## Fall Rate Identification, Detection, and Analysis (FRIDA) Project 
The FRIDA project has been created to be a preliminary step in developing a software system capable of being used inside a person’s place of residence to detect falls. To achieve this goal, the software utilizes a PyTorch convolutional neural network with an OpenCV framework in order to implement real-time tracking of an individual inside their residence to montior for fall situations. The software is not designed to track multiple individuals at once. Notification of when a fall is occuring is issued after the system has detected a fall. Overall, the major benefit of the FRIDA project is a confirmation in the form of an minimum viable product for detection of falls in those needing protection and monitoring for fall situations.
